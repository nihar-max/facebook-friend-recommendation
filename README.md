# Facebook-Friend-Recommendation

## Problem Statement:
### Imagine Users in social media as Nodes (dots)  and friendship/relationship between users as edges/Links

### Here Each user is Node/Vertex
### Line connected to it is edge/link   (Here Edges are divided in 2 Categories)
### Directed and Undirected 
#### Here in given image lets, User 0 follows User 3 , User 4, User 1 , but they dont follow back so such type of edge/link is Known as directed edge (mostly we are going to work on this type of data)
